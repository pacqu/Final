Final Project - Period 10 APCS
Members: Justin Pacquing, Christopher Liang, Jeffrey Zou 

For our project we made a typing game using processing. There are two modes, timed and lives. To play, click play and select which mode you would like. The game then begins and you start typing. The goal is to match what you are currently typing to a word on the screen before it disappears.

Controls:
a-z - these letters are used to type the word
enter/return - when you complete a word, hit this button and you will earn points based on its length
backspace - delete the previous character
esc - (only for lives mode) pause menu

Concepts:
Processing - our game is based in this
Nodes - to form queues and stacks
Queue - as a structure to store what words will be dropped
Stack - keep track of most recent words used

Bugs/problems:
-When spawning, the words can overlap.
-The words may also be cut off by the edge.

Enjoy the game!
